## 2022 Blender Animation workshop

I had the amazing opportunity to attend in person, the Blender animation 2025 workshop.

This talk is the result of all of our work. I'm the Nate that get's the callout for my "nice" concept art (It's really not that great lol). I also got to work with the amazing [Nathan Vegdahl](https://www.youtube.com/user/cessen2/videos?app=desktop) on these concepts / designs.

I also help write and edit the [The Future of Character Animation](https://code.blender.org/2022/11/the-future-of-character-animation-rigging/) blog post.

If you want to continue to follow my Blender development journey, you can find my contributions [here](https://developer.blender.org/p/nrupsis/), and my Blender development blog [Blunder](blunder.training).
