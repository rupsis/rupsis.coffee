These series of blog posts are really just a dumping ground for my thoughts on [The Science of Happiness](https://www.edx.org/course/the-science-of-happiness-3) course.

## What is Happiness?

Week 1 focuses on the question "What is Happiness?".

In the introduction video, we set the state by defining at an incredibly high level some of the different philosophies and thinkings of notable individuals throughout history, and their different ideas of what happiness is all about.

Moving to the second video, there is a shift to a more scientific approach to happiness. We review Danny Kahneman's Conceptual domains of happiness, and learn that the course will be heavily focused on "Well-Being" (overall happiness) and "Emotions".

We get a glimps of Ed Diener's "equation" for happiness:

```
(Overall Well-Being) + SUM(Emotions) = Happiness (Subjective well being)
// where emotions are positive and negative
```

I assume this is one of the main reasons we'll be spending some significant time studying well-being and emotions. It's then mentioned the different measurements of happiness (Observation, Cross-Sectional, etc), which is the foundational element to a scientific approach. I hope that a great deal of time is spent covering methods of measurement. As Peter Drucker states: <quote>"You can't manage what you don't measure"</quote>, or re-phrased: <quote>"What get's measured, gets managed"</quote>. So a solid system of measurement to me seems like a key factor in achieving happiness.

Week 1 continues with a couple readings. It covers some terminology explanations (Life Satisfaction, Positive Affect, etc) that'll help us define happiness. It then takes us to an essay by Darrin McMahon on happiness. This short essay (I think it's an excerpt from his book: "Happiness: A History") goes over the etymology of happiness, from several different languages, and the common theme is that happiness pertains to some degree of luck. This is contrasted with the Roman and Greek schools of thought that happiness is rooted in virtue, and a life well lived.
