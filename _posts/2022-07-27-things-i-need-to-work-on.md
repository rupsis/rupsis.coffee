There are a great many things I need to work on. For instance, my attention is very finicky. I was in the middle of reading a [blog post](https://shuvomoy.github.io/blogs/posts/Knuth-on-work-habits-and-problem-solving-and-happiness/), when my [monkey brain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) decided that _now_ was the very best time to write this. Add attention span to the list...

It might take me a great many years to finally be able to say i've "learned" to do X, but any forward progress will still yield benefits.

So anyways, here are some things I need to work on:

### Getting up

I'm not a morning person. But of the days I've woke up early, man you can get a lot done. This one will probably be a life long battle for me, but if I can ever "figure" it out, I'll be a happy man.

### Attention span

For the most part I'm not on social media. I hated Facebook before it was cool. But it's not even social media that's derailed out concentration. It's the plethora of distractions this world offers. For me, it's not always recreation that sings the siren's song, most often it's _other work_. Yes, thats right. I'll be working on something, but "man, that other thing would also be fun to work on...". Hopping back and forth to different projects feels like you're making progress, but really, it's like taking a bite out of every cookie in the jar. I need a parent to scold me I guess.

### Writing / Editing

I suppose my blog can speak for itself when it comes to editing.

Writing on the other hand is so incredibly valuable. Not even just to communicate, but as an extension of thought. I need to me more diligent about writing notes, and things of the like.

### Browser tabs

I have a (bad?) habit of using my browser as a sort of "queue" for items that i _might_ get back to later. at the moment I have multiple windows open, and probably some 100ish tabs...

### Flow

This goes along with attention span, but I need to get better at entering flow state. I need to provide myself with large chunks of uninterrupted time where I can really dig into something. Flow state is really a wonderful feeling. Like a runners high.

Speaking of which

### Exercise

My body for the most part is a vessel to carry my brain around. Which... isn't a good way to look at it. The two or (shockingly) very connected. Physical fitness plays a large part in my overall mood, and energy level. I sit at a desk all day, and it's a slippery slope to not prioritize moving.

There are plenty more things I want to work on (3D artwork, OSS contributions, etc), but I think the items listed above are enough to start.

What are some things you should work on?
